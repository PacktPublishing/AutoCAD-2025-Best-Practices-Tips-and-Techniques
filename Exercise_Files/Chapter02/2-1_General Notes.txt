                       GENERAL NOTES:

1.   BUILDING TO BE REMOVED BY OTHERS, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

2.   EXISTING DRAINAGE STRUCTURES WITHIN CONSTRUCTION LIMITS
     SHALL (BE REMOVED/REMAIN,) UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED. 

3.   WHEN THERE ARE NO UTILITY ADJUSTMENT SHEETS IN THE PLANS,
     THE NOTES SHOWN FOR "UTILITY ADJUSTMENT SHEETS NOTES"
     SHALL BE INCLUDED HERE AS PART OF THE GENERAL NOTES:

       A. THE LOCATION(S) OF THE UTILITIES SHOWN IN THE PLANS
          (including those designated Vv, Vh and Vvh) ARE
          BASED ON LIMITED INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUES AND
          SHOULD BE CONSIDERED APPROXIMATE ONLY. THE
          VERIFIED LOCATIONS / ELEVATIONS APPLY ONLY AT THE
          POINT SHOWN.  INTERPOLATIONS BETWEEN THESE
          POINTS HAVE NOT BEEN VERIFIED.
    
4.    (IF THERE ARE NO DRAINAGE STRUCTURE SHEETS IN THE PLANS, THE FOLLOWING
       NOTES SHALL BE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL NOTES, IF APPLICABLE):

         A. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS DIRECTED TO THE FACT THAT PORTIONS OF 
           SOME DRAINAGE STRUCTURES EXTEND INTO THE STABILIZED PORTION 
           OF THE ROADBED AND EXTREME CAUTION WILL BE NECESSARY IN
           STABILIZATION OPERATIONS AT THOSE LOCATIONS.

5.    ANY PUBLIC LAND CORNER WITHIN THE LIMITS OF CONSTRUCTION IS TO BE
      PROTECTED. IF A CORNER MONUMENT IS IN DANGER OF BEING DESTROYED AND
      HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY REFERENCED, THE ENGINEER SHOULD NOTIFY THE
      DISTRICT LOCATION SURVEYOR, WITHOUT DELAY, BY TELEPHONE. 

6.    EXISTING DRIVEWAYS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THIS PROJECT 
      ARE TO BE REPLACED AT THE SAME LOCATION AND WIDTH, UNLESS
      OTHERWISE SHOWN IN THE PLANS.
      
      EXISTING DRIVEWAYS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED FOR CONFORMANCE WITH 
      FAC RULE 14 97.003(1)(B).  THOSE THAT ARE IN SUBSTANTIAL
      CONFORMANCE WITH THE RULE AND THAT ARE TO REMAIN AT THERE
      EXISTING LOCATIONS, ARE NOT SHOWN ON THE PLANS BUT ARE TO BE
      RECONSTRUCTED IN CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS.  THOSE THAT ARE TO BE
      RELOCATED OR CLOSED ARE DETAILED ON THE PLANS.
